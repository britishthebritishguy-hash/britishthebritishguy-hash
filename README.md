# About me!!

**britishthebritishguy-hash/britishthebritishguy-hash** is a  _special_  repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-  I’m currently working on my Undertale *like* game, Arven! But, I'm doing a practice project first.
-  I’m currently learning japanese! And how to code.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on games that anyone's making! I mostly do art but I can code too.
-  I’m looking for help with javascript because it's hard to code in.
-  Ask me about Undertale! Or chess! Or maybe Deltarune. I also like Fallout.
-  Reach me on my discord which is just the same as my username here but without the -hash
-  Pronouns: He/him (always assume he/him), she/they, or 'i/'im/'ey

  I know that my name is ACEy on here, but most people refer to me as/you can also refer to me as:
  1. Kaleb
  2. Ash
  3. Fletcher
  4. Ace/Acey/Spades

  Always assume I'm Kaleb first; usually my status will tell you something abt that, but you can always ask if your not sure, or I don't tell you.
